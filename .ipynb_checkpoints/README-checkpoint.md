##  📈 Quantitative Analysis of Stock Market Using Python

### 🧠Background
Stock markets are inherently volatile and influenced by a wide range of economic, political, and psychological factors. Investors and analysts rely on quantitative analysis to derive actionable insights from historical price data. This project aims to evaluate the performance, volatility, correlation, and risk-return characteristics of major tech stocks—AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and NFLX—over a selected time period.


### 💼 Business Problem
Investors need to make informed decisions about which stocks to include in their portfolios. However, without a systematic method to compare performance, volatility, and risk, investment strategies may be poorly optimized. This project addresses:

- Which stock demonstrated the best performance over the period?

- Which stock had the highest volatility (risk)?

- How correlated are these stocks with each other?

- Which stocks offered the best trade-off between risk and return?
